## About The Project

The Wolves is a project developed by the Made Tech Academy of Winter/Spring 2019. It set out to solve the problem of billable people not filling in their timesheets on time and the need for the Operations team to manually send reminders.

This application solves this problem by automatically reminding billable people that have not submitted their timesheets through a Slack direct message and publicly listing all those yet to do so by the deadline.

### Built With

- [C# using .NET Core Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/)

### Technical Architecture

The Wolves is a C# application that follows the principles of [Clean Architecture (CA)](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html). It is deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) and utilises [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).

<p align="center">
  <img src="images/technical-architecture.png" alt="Logo" width="500">
</p>

Following CA, we have three sea-level use cases:

- [RemindBillablePeople](CryptoTechReminderSystem/UseCase/RemindBillablePeople.cs)

Each of which have use case dependencies on:

- [GetBillablePeople](CryptoTechReminderSystem/UseCase/GetBillablePeople.cs) which calls the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) to get a list of people. Exclusions can be added to the NON_BILLABLE_PEOPLE environment variable to stop those people being messaged.
- [SendReminder](CryptoTechReminderSystem/UseCase/SendReminder.cs) which calls the [Slack API](https://api.slack.com/) to send out reminders.

We then have `CryptoTechReminderSystem.Main/Program.cs`, which schedules when the
above use cases should be called. The Wolves have two jobs:

- `RemindBillablePeopleJob` which sends a Slack direct message to billable people to fill in their timesheets. It runs once at 10am on a Friday or the last day of the month.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- [.NET Core 2.2 ](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/2.2)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/madetech/the-wolves.git
```

2. Within `the-wolves` directory, restore the dependencies for the application

```sh
dotnet restore
```

## Usage

### Running the application

To locally run the application, there is a set of environment variables that need to be set, see [`CryptoTechReminderSystem.Main/.env-default`](CryptoTechReminderSystem.Main/.env-default).

1. Create a `.env` file within `CryptoTechReminderSystem.Main` and set the following environment variables:

```sh
SLACK_TOKEN=
SLACK_CHANNEL_ID=
SLACK_REMINDER_MESSAGE=
SLACK_PM_REMINDER_MESSAGE=
SLACK_BILLABLE_PEOPLE_MESSAGE=
NON_BILLABLE_PEOPLE=
```

The NON_BILLABLE_PEOPLE should be in the format "jim@email.com,bob@email.com"

2. Run the application using:

```sh
dotnet run
```

### Running the tests

The application has two namespaced set of tests:

- `CryptoTechReminderSystem.AcceptanceTest` for acceptance tests
- `CryptoTechReminderSystem.Test` for unit tests

To run all tests:

```sh
dotnet test
```

## Deployment

We use [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com) to host our application as a [Heroku Dyno](https://www.heroku.com/dynos) and automatic deployment is configured. This means whenever `master` is updated, a deployment will be triggered.

It is still possible to manually deploy using [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) and Git.

### Deploying to Heroku with Git

You must have [Heroku CLI](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-cli) installed.

1. Login into Heroku

```sh
heroku login
```

2. Add the remote for the Heroku Git repository for `cryptotech-reminders`

```sh
heroku git:remote -a cryptotech-reminders
```

> You can then confirm that a remote for `Heroku` has been added by running:
>
> ```sh
> git remote -v
> ```
>
> The output should then be the following:
>
> ```sh
> heroku  https://git.heroku.com/cryptotech-reminders.git (fetch)
> heroku  https://git.heroku.com/cryptotech-reminders.git (push)
> origin  git@github.com:madetech/the-wolves.git (fetch)
> origin  git@github.com:madetech/the-wolves.git (push)
> ```

3. Ensuring `master` is up-to-date, deploy the local repository's `master` branch, to Heroku remote

```sh
git push heroku master
```

For more information about deploying to Heroku, see Heroku's guide - [Deploying with Git](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git).
